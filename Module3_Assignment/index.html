                        Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them
                        in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures
                        around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.
                    
                        Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among
                        many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a
                        staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of
                        cholesterol and saturated fat.
                    
                        The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts
                        of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods, while
                        less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to
                        be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.

                        Chicken meat contains about two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured as 
                        weight percentage.

                        Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself (castrated roosters excluded). The fat is highly concentrated on
                        the skin. A 100g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 grams of fat and 31 grams of protein, compared to 10 grams
                        of fat and 27 grams of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.
                        Chicken is sold both as whole birds and broken down into pieces.

                        In the United Kingdom, juvenile chickens of less than 28 days of age at slaughter are marketed as poussin. Mature
                        chicken is sold as small, medium or large.

                        In the United States, whole mature chickens are marketed as fryers, broilers, and roasters. Fryers are the smallest size
                        (2.5-4 lbs dressed for sale), and the most common, as chicken reach this size quickly (about 7 weeks). Broilers are
                        larger than fryers. Roasters, or roasting hens, are the largest chickens commonly sold (3–5 months and 6-8 lbs) and are
                        typically more expensive. Even larger and older chickens are called stewing chickens but these are no longer usually
                        found commercially. The names reflect the most appropriate cooking method for the surface area to volume ratio. As the
                        size increases, the volume (which determines how much heat must enter the bird for it to be cooked) increases faster
                        than the surface area (which determines how fast heat can enter the bird). For a fast method of cooking, such as frying,
                        a small bird is appropriate: frying a large piece of chicken results in the inside being undercooked when the outside is
                        ready.
                        
                        Chicken is also sold broken down into pieces. Such pieces usually come from smaller birds that would qualify as fryers
                        if sold whole. Pieces may include quarters, or fourths of the chicken. A chicken is typically cut into two leg quarters
                        and two breast quarters. Each quarter contains two of the commonly available pieces of chicken. A leg quarter contains
                        the thigh, drumstick and a portion of the back; a leg has the back portion removed. A breast quarter contains the
                        breast, wing and portion of the back; a breast has the back portion and wing removed. Pieces may be sold in packages of
                        all of the same pieces, or in combination packages. Whole chicken cut up refers to either the entire bird cut into 8
                        individual pieces. (8-piece cut); or sometimes without the back. A 9-piece cut (usually for fast food restaurants) has
                        the tip of the breast cut off before splitting. Pick of the chicken, or similar titles, refers to a package with only
                        some of the chicken pieces, typically the breasts, thighs, and legs without wings or back. Thighs and breasts are sold
                        boneless and/or skinless. Chicken livers and/or gizzards are commonly available packaged separately. Other parts of the
                        chicken, such as the neck, feet, combs, etc. are not widely available except in countries where they are in demand, or
                        in cities that cater to ethnic groups who favor these parts.
